# A Billion Sounds

![](./src/assets/gfx/art/wall2-big.png?raw=true)

**A Billion Sounds: A Deep Space Blizzard short story** is a graphical action-adventure game about subcultures, underground communities and the music industry. 

[Set in a unique post-apocalyptic cyberpunk world](https://katamori.github.io/deep-space-blizzard/index.html), it tells its story through the eyes of *Tony*, a mysterious ex-drifter who starts a new life by participating in the everyday work related to a famous underground nightclub, The Void Shard.

"A Billion Sounds" is my personal attempt to express my feelings, ideas and impressions (mostly) about interactions I personally experienced during various periods of my life - all within the confinements of a personally designed world with cyberpunk ideas and aesthetics. 

Being exceptionally story-driven, the project has a very slow pace as I try to make everything fit; moreover, I have very limited time to spend on this project AND actually producing tangible results in this repo.

**ATTENTION!** Almost everything in this repository can be considered spoiler-heavy content. If you'd like to preserve immersion and/or are not examining the code for development purposes, be very careful!
