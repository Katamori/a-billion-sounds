# Misc info

Sanctuary's currency is the Quartz.

1 Quartz, or 1q roughly equals 0.005 USD (or 1.6 HUF on 2020-02-15 price)

-------

In Sanctuary, coffee is state symbol. It's like kaviar: extremely expensive, but not too useful in on its own and/or in small amounts, thus even in cheap form, is not really welcome among regular people.

-------

Many old world subcultures still exist; the most prominent of which are metalheads, punks, goths and synthwavers.

Some are disappeared (emos) or ascended to mainstream (rappers).
